# DanaTix Full-Stack project

A simple lightweight full-stack app concept to purchase and manage public transportation tickets

Users should be able to:
* Register
* Login
* Freely change their profile
* Purchase tickets or passes
* Validate tickets or passes
* View news/announcements... which might contain information about delays... on our imaginary public transportation network
* Be able to do all that using his/her mobile

The backend and frontend part of the application communicates using REST API endpoints, but we also want to make sure the information sent stays secure

Backend security features:
* CORS filter
* JWT filter
* Email verification filter

Frontend security features:
* Authorization with middleware

The project includes both unit and integration tests
