# DanaTix Full-Stack project

A simple lightweight full-stack app concept to purchase and manage public transportation tickets

Users should be able to:
-Register
-Login
-Freely change their profile
-Purchase tickets or passes
-Validate tickets or passes
-View news/announcements... which might contain information about delays... on our imaginary public transportation network

The backend and frontend part of the application communicates using REST API endpoints, but we also want to make sure the information sent stays secure

Backend security features:
-CORS filter
-JWT filter
-Email verification filter

Frontend security features:
-Authorization with middleware

# Frontend

# Other requirements
